Project description: ML-based program that transcribes text from an image
Students: Travis Durrant and Timothy Weathers

Project idea:
Expanding on the above brief, the program will be given an image and after that spit out a text file containing the transcription.
This will be powered by a (*double-check this) reinforcement based machine learning algorithm.
This algorithm will be responsible for detecting the text, and a script will turn it into a text file.

Resources: Python, training data (single characters and longer), testing data (single characters and longer)

BGM:
The most important is the data, which can be either found online (MNIST).
TensorFlow looks like a library we want, though I haven't extensively looked through it yet.
Keras website has a lot of good documentation, might be better than TensorFlow (research later).
Even if we don't use it, they have a lot of good examples to learn from.
SciKit looks easy, and also has good guides and documentation.

I think SciKit is the best one to start with, and maybe pivot (jump ship) later.
Only if it turns out to have been the wrong choice, though.
