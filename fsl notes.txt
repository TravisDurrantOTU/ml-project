- FSL (few shot) begins with meta learning
- meta learning is training the model on the patterns on learning instead of just patterns in images
- meta learning is trained off multiple sets of tasks 
- possible datasets for FSL: omniglot miniImagenet FC100 tieredImagenet
- FSL for optimization based models (us) is essentially having a learner model that is trained for a specific task and having a meta learner model trained on multiple tasks adjust the learner model
- we can use a recurring neural network while the network is optimized using gradient descent to replace gradient descent in our meta learning model to teach the meta-learning model to learn gradient descent( we are doing this because gradient descent wouldn't work on a meta learning model due to the low sample size)
