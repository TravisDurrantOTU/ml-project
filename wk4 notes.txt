I read a lot of tensorflow API documentation

Decided to load the MNIST data directly from tensorflow, because it saves on work

Architecture of the model is exactly what I wrote about last week,
with the sole exception of tensorflow handling cross-validation rather easily
so cross-validation is not a week 6 task

Next week:
Want to increase the accuracy of the model
	- Think about adding more layers
	- Or more filters to existing layers
	- Think about changing activation
Want to generate more useful metrics than just true guesses / total guesses
	- For example, what gets mapped to what (wrongly)
	- Like, are 8's being mistaken for 9's? 7's for 1's?
Want to generate plots and stuff that will look good in a report
	- The above would look good on some nice bar graphs
Especially want to make it show wrong guesses for human inspection
	- I read on some useful page that I noted down last week
	- That some of the wrong guesses are just nonsensice
	- like an 8 that just looked like a blob type shi
