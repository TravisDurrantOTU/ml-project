tentative plan moving forward

Week 1: (over)
Week 2: (current)
- Researching
- Making this plan
- Figuring out what math is involved (it's a lot I recognize from adv. lin. alg.)

Week 3:
- Working on conceptual stuff (this might take a lot longer than I intially thought)
	- Pseudocode for decoding algorithm to turn image into tensor
	- Pseudocode for loss function, estimate error, etc.
	- Diagram of architecture (for visualization)

Week 4:
- Implementation
	- Download TensorFlow
	- Start by implementing the decoding
	- Work from there based on diagram

Week 5:
- Continue writing code from week 4 ONLY IF DELAYED
	- (DO NOT PLAN TO STILL BE WRITING FUNCTIONS THIS WEEK)
- Work on taking new data to prediction algorithm
- So need to resize, and mask the data so it looks like whatever we did to the training data
	- See notes on embedding, essentially will need to lower resolution of images
- Start improving the model if time permits

Week 6:
- Implement cross-validation, and any other improvements thought possible
- Set aside a lil time for a 10 page report
