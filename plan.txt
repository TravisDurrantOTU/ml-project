tentative plan moving forward

Week 1: (over)
Week 2: (current)
- Researching
- Making this plan
- Figuring out what math is involved (it's a lot I recognize fro adv. lin. alg.)

Week 3:
- Working on conceptual stuff (this might take a lot longer than I intially thought)
	- Pseudocode for decoding algorithm to turn image into tensor
	- Pseudocode for other functions

Week 4:
- Implementation
	- Decide on which library to use
	- Write the above functions into python
	- Test and make sure they work as expected

Week 5:
- Continue writing code from week 4 ONLY IF DELAYED
	- (DO NOT PLAN TO STILL BE WRITING FUNCTIONS THIS WEEK)
- Work on taking new data to prediction algorithm
- So need to resize, and mask the data so it looks like whatever we did to the training data
	- See notes on embedding, essentially will need to lower resolution of images

Week 6:
- The above will probably take a while
- And we have to write a godforsaken 10 page report
- So that
